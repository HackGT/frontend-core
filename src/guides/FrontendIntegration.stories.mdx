# Frontend Integration

This guide covers how to integrate a frontend application with our Google Firebase
and Google Cloud Identity Platform authentication system. After following this guide,
your application will be able to login a user and retrieve a user's login details.

## Initial Setup

First, you will need to retrieve credentials from the Google Cloud Identity
Platform console or from a teammate.

To retrieve these credentials yourself, follow these steps:

1. Visit our `hexlabs-cloud` project in Google Cloud and navigate to Identity Platform.
   Or, click on [this](https://console.cloud.google.com/customer-identity/providers?authuser=1&project=hexlabs-cloud)
   link to navigate there directly.
2. On the Identity Platform "Providers" tab, select the "Application Setup Details"
   button in the top right corner.
3. A popup will open showing the `apiKey` and `authDomain` you can copy. Note that
   this values are not sensitive and can be committed to version control.

## Code Integration

You will need to install `firebase` through `yarn install firebase`. Then,
you can use this template `App.tsx` file to setup Firebase Authentication. You will
need to fill in the `apiKey` and `authDomain` values that you retrieved in the
previous step.

The steps are explained below in comments, but can be removed after copying.

```tsx
import { useLogin, LoadingScreen, AuthProvider } from "@hex-labs/core";

// Initialized the Firebase app through the credentials provided
export const app = initializeApp({
  apiKey: "[Your apiKey here]",
  authDomain: "[Your authDomain here]",
});
// Sets the Firebase persistence to in memory since we use cookies for session
// management. These cookies are set by the backend on login/logout.
setPersistence(getAuth(app), inMemoryPersistence);

// By default sends axios requests with user session cookies so that the backend
// can verify the user's identity.
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

export const App = () => {
  // Retrieves the user's login state. This hook will also make requests to log
  // the user in
  const [loading, loggedIn] = useLogin(app);

  // If loading, show a loading screen
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  // If not loading and the user is not logged in, redirect to the login frontend
  // with a redirect param so that the user can login and come back to the page
  // they were on.
  if (!loading && !loggedIn) {
    window.location.href = `https://login.hexlabs.org?redirect=${window.location.href}`;
  }

  // Sets up the AuthProvider so that any part of the application can use the
  // useAuth hook to retrieve the user's login details.
  return (
    <AuthProvider app={app}>
      <div>Hello World!</div>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
};
```
