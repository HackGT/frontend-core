# useAuth

A authentication hook providers the current user's authentication state and loading
state. It will update when user logs in or out depending on their Firebase auth state.

This hook should be used in conjunction with `AuthProvider` to provide user state
to the rest of the application.

## Import

```typescript
import { AuthContext } from "@hex-labs/core";
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type        | Description                                            |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| app  | FirebaseApp | The initialized Firebase app to use for authentication |

## Return value

It returns an object with two fields:

- `user` - The current Firebase user data if logged in. Otherwise `null`.
- `loading` - A boolean that is true when the hook is loading the user's login
  information

## Usage

### Example

This hook is used to retrieve the user's uid to use for requests.

```tsx
export const Component = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  return <div>Hello user: ${user.uid}</div>;
};
```
