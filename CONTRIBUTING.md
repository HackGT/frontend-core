# Contributing to Frontend Core

Frontend core is shared React components used for all HexLabs frontend projects.

## Release

To release a new version, run `yarn release` and `git push --follow-tags origin master` to push the tags as well. Once the commits are pushed, GitHub Actions will run a workflow to publish a new version to npm.
